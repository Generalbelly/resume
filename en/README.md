## Job Description

As I have more than 7 years of experience as a developer working for startups, I have the spirit of "let's just try and make it".  
On the other hand, I know that if the initial design and implementation is not good enough, it will cost a lot to fix them especially when the product grows, so I can balance between the two. (Of course, there are many problems that will not become apparent until the product is scaled.)  
I also recognize the importance of sales, marketing, and customer support in getting a business off the ground, so we can work together while respecting each other's work.
